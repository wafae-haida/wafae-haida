I am a Junior Frontend developer, with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.
Before, I worked as a full-stack intern at ITIC SOLUTION company, where I built the visitor and customer sections of a website dedicated to managing a car rental agency, using Laravel 9, JavaScript, and HeidiSQL.
I bring a unique combination of skills and perspectives to a junior Frontend role, also I have experience in both frontend and backend roles, and I keep seeking new knowledge and skills through self-learning.
In my spare time âš¡, I like to stay fit and active by working out, I also like to write. When I write, I relax completely and find myself in another world. It helps me think outside the box and use my imagination and creative sides. I also like meditation since it helps to organize my thoughts.
